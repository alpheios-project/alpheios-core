/**
 * A public information about published event that is returned to subscriber.

 * This will help to avoid creating dependencies on PsEvent internals within subscribers functions.
 * Thus an PsEventData object can be considered as a publicly exposed part of PsEvent data.
 * If needed, PsEventData can present PsEvent data to subscriber differently,
 * not in the way PsEvent stores it. This makes sense as subscriber might be interested in
 * a different angle of PsEvent information. PsEventData may add properties or methods
 * that do not needed within an PsEvent, but might be useful to subscribers.
