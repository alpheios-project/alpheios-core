Perfects in īvī often omit the v but rarely contract the vowels, except before ss or st, and sometimes in the third person. In addition to the use of v or u, the Active perfect stem can also be formed in a number of other ways, such as the addition of s to the root (eg carpsi), reduplication of the root (eg cecidi from cado), and simple lengthening of the vowel (eg vidī from video or legī from lego).\"\n4,\"Dic, duc, fac, and fer lack a final vowel in the imperative in classical Latin.
