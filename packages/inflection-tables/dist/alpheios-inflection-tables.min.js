in poetry.\r\n3,"In tenses based on the perfect stem (the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect of the Active voice) a v between two vowels is often lost with contraction of the two vowels, thus āvī to ā, ēvī to ē, ōvi to ō. Perfects in īvī often omit the v but rarely contract the vowels, except before ss or st, and sometimes in the third person. In addition to the use of v or u, the Active perfect stem can also be formed in a number of other ways, such as the addition of s to the root (eg carpsi), reduplication of the root (eg cecidi from cado), and simple lengthening of the vowel (eg vidī from video or legī from lego)."\r\n4,"Dic, duc, fac, and fer lack a final vowel in the imperative in classical Latin. The singular imperative of the verb sciō is always scītō, and the plural is usually scītōte."\r\n5,Common in epic poetry.\r\n6,Present in early Latin but chiefly confined to popular use until Livy and later writers.\r\n7,The verb fīō is a 4th conjugation verb that is irregular in only two forms: the present infinitive fierī and the imperfect subjunctive
