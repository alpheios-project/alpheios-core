        added test cases for Dictionary search (/content/test-plan#comment-23)

        added test cases for Greek Dictionary search

        additional tests needed (/content/test-plan#comment-21)

        Submitted by BridgetAlmas (/users/bridgetalmas) on Mon, 09/28/2009 - 09:23.

        1) Under inflection tables, grammar and treebank, we should add test cases for each part of speech. Need to make sure to test at
        least one match on each distinct inflection table in each language.

        2) Under greek inflection tables, we should also add tests for matches on endings which don't appear by default (e.g. dialect
        variations)

        3) Need also to test inflection matching which ignores accents, diaresis, etc.

        4) Under Quizzes, need to add test cases for each supported part of speech

        5) Add tests for each item in the Alpheios toolbar (e.g. About, Help, Feedback, Site) for both basic toolbar and in site enhanced
        text toolbar

        6) Test dictionary search order (Greek)

        7) Add test cases for some of the strange diambiguation scenarios for enhanced texts? (E.g. See Bugs 299 and 262)

            added test cases for Greek (/content/test-plan#comment-22)

            Submitted by MonicaZugan (/users/monicazugan) on Wed, 09/30/2009 - 14:00.

            added test cases for Greek Inflection tables (1,2,3 and 7) - I think comment 5 is pretty much covered. maybe I'll add a new test
            case.
