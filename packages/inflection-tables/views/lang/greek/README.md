# Pronouns

Greek pronouns are presented in different tables. The choice of table mostly depends on a pronoun's
grammatical class.

* Grouped by lemma and gender are: demonstrative pronouns.
* Grouped by person and gender are: reflexive pronouns.
* Grouped by gender: general relative, indefinite, intensive, interrogative, reciprocal, and relative pronouns.
* Grouped by person are: personal pronouns.
* Possessive pronouns: TBD

All pronoun vies have a `pronoun` word in their names. A `matchFilter` function is responsible 
for a decision of what pronoun view should be used to represent a table.
