/**
 * An abstract storage adapter class for an Options object. Implements two methods: set() and get().
 * A `domain` argument of a constructor designates a storage area where options key-value pairs
 * are stored. This allows to avoid possible collisions with other options objects.
 *
 * Local storage can contain multiple key-value pairs. get() with an empty parameter
 * should return all keys related to the particular object (e.g. set of options). A set of those keys
 * is defined by the `domain` concept. A key named `domain-name-key` is saved to the
 * local storage along with its key-value pairs. This special key
 * will contain an array of keys that belong to the storage domain. If no key values are provided,
 * get() function will use a list of those stored keys to retrieve all values that belong to a domain.
